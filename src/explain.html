	<h1>What is a flow network?</h1>
	<p>A flow network is a directed graph where each node has a capacity and each edge recieves a flow.
		This graph is generally used to model the transportation of resources between locations which have a network of routes with limited capacity,
		which naturally brings up the problem of maximum flow. Finding out maximum flow to allow for the most efficient routes have real world applications
		such as in transport, utilities and economics.</p>

	<h1>How does the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm work?</h1>
	<p>The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm was discovered in 1956 and can vary from implementation as it is not fully specified. 
		The algorithm works by repeatedly finding augmented paths and calculating flow throughout the routes that are available as well as residual capacity as well. </p>
