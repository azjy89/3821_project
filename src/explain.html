	<h1>
		What is a Flow Network?
	</h1>
	<p>
		A flow network is a directed graph where each node has a capacity and each edge receives a flow. This graph is generally used to model the transportation of 
		resources between locations which have a network of routes with limited capacity, which naturally brings up the problem of maximum flow. Finding out maximum 
		flow to allow for the most efficient routes have real world applications such as in transport, utilities and economics.
	</p>
	<h1>
		The Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm
	</h1>
	<p>
		The Ford-Fulkerson algorithm works by finding augmented paths and calculating flow throughout the routes. It starts with the initial flow of zero.
		If a capacity is not full along a path, which is found using a graph transversal algorithm such as breath-first search or depth-first search, then the algorithm 
		works by augmenting it through making sure the edge flow does not exceed the given capacity and incoming flow is equal to outgoing flow except for the source 
		and sink vertices. This is done by increasing the flow along a path by its maximum amount that does not violate the rules mentioned before.
	</p>
	<p>The time complexity is O(E &times; F), where E is the number of edges and F is the maximum flow of the graph.</p>
	<p>The space complexity is O(V &#43; E), as we need to track all of the edges and verticies for the residual graph.</p>
	<h1>
		The Edmond-Karp Algorithm
	</h1>
	<p>
		The Edmond-Karp algorithm works by finding the augmented paths and calculating flow throughout the routes. It works very similarly to the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm 
		as it is an optimised version of the former algorithm, however it specifies to use a breath-first search as a way of finding paths to be augmented. The use of a 
		breath-first search graph transversal guarantees that the augmented paths found will be the shortest ones, thus saving time from the original algorithm. 
		
	</p>
	<p>The time complexity is then O(VE<sup>2</sup>), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.</p>
	<p>The space complexity is O(V &plus; E), similarly to Ford-Fulkerson algorithm.</p>
	<h1>
		Dinic's Algorithm
	</h1>
	<p>
		Dinic's algorithm is also an optimisation on the Ford-Fulkerson and Edmond-Karp algorithm. This is done by using a level graph, which determines the level from the 
		source vertex, and through this, the algorithm can send multiple flows into the graph. It uses the levels to determine the paths quicker by determining if there is a 
		path from a level 0 to 1 to 2â€¦ to the sink vertex level. If there is no more flow that can be added on, meaning there is no capacity or path from the residual graph 
		then it has reached blocking flow. This use of level graph means that flow is more efficiently sent and the program will terminate earlier than the previous iterations.  
	</p>
	<p>The time complexity is O(EV<sup>2</sup>), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices.</p>
	<p>The space complexity is also O(V &#43; E), since it requires O(V) to store the level array and O(E) to store the graph adjacency list.</p>
